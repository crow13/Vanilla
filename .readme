1. The purpose of Vanilla project is to rewrite some of the most commonly used JQuery functions in plain "Vanilla" JavaScript for both education about JavaScript and for speed enhancement.
2. Installation of Vanilla is simple.  Just reference the files called for at the top of the demo for the appropriate function/widget.  I recommend that you eliminate duplicates to maximize speed enhancement.
